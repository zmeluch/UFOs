# UFO Sightings

## Overview of Project
In helping Dana in publishing her web app on UFO sighitings, javascript and html were used
to create a webpage with a dynamic table. To help Dana provide more in depth anaylsis, the code
was refactored. After refactoring the code, a more interactive table that allows filtering on five elements
instead of one was created. In doing so, Dana gave her audience greater control of the data and enable them
to draw better analysis.

## Summary

- One drawback of the webpage is that you have to search by a specfic date, where finding dates within 
	a range may be more effective for the users than having to keep typing in specific dates.
- To help advance the site, an input where the user could set a date range could be better for finding
	data for the users.
- Another development that could help the site would the ability to sort the columns of the table.
